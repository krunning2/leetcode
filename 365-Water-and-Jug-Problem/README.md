Forget about two jugs pouring between each other, which may make you confused.

Let's make it simple: assuming we have one big enough bucket and two cups with volume x and y, respectively. Now we want to perform a series of operation -- pouring water in and out only by those two cups with exactly amount x or y. Somehow, there will be only z water left in this big bucket eventually. Then the equation will be:

z = m * x + n * y
m means using cup-x m times. If m is positive, it means pouring in. Otherwise, it's pouring out.
n is similar.

For example, 4 = (-2) * 3 + 2 * 5, which means you pour in water twice with cup-5 and pour out water twice with cup-3. Talk back to the question, it's like we first fill jug-5, pour water to jug-3 from jug-5, empty jug-3, pour the remaining 2 water into jug-3 from jug-5, fill jug-5 again, pour water into jug-3 from jug-5, empty jug-3, then we have only 4 water left in jug-5. It's exactly fill jug-5 twice and empty jug-3 twice.

Now the question is, can we find those two m and n exist?

The answer is YES. Here we need a little math -- Bezout's identity, which is:

We can always find a and b to satisfy ax + bx = d where d = gcd(x, y)

So, everything is clear, if z % d == 0, then we have (a*z/d)*x + (b*z/d)*y = z, which means m and n exist.

Below is the code:
