1. keep two maps, targetMap and sourceMap, and one counter.
2. Use two pointers, firstly, move one pointer to the position where it satisfies or the end, meanwhile increase value sourceMap for each key and increase the counter if ( ....).
3. then check the window size.
4. move the slow pointer and decrease the counter and the value of sourceMap
